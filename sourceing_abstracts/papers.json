[{"title": "A Joint Fermi-GBM and Swift-BAT Analysis of Gravitational-Wave Candidates from the Third Gravitational-wave Observing Run", "summary": "We present Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM) and Swift Burst Alert\nTelescope (Swift-BAT) searches for gamma-ray/X-ray counterparts to\ngravitational wave (GW) candidate events identified during the third observing\nrun of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Using Fermi-GBM on-board\ntriggers and sub-threshold gamma-ray burst (GRB) candidates found in the\nFermi-GBM ground analyses, the Targeted Search and the Untargeted Search, we\ninvestigate whether there are any coincident GRBs associated with the GWs. We\nalso search the Swift-BAT rate data around the GW times to determine whether a\nGRB counterpart is present. No counterparts are found. Using both the Fermi-GBM\nTargeted Search and the Swift-BAT search, we calculate flux upper limits and\npresent joint upper limits on the gamma-ray luminosity of each GW. Given these\nlimits, we constrain theoretical models for the emission of gamma-rays from\nbinary black hole mergers.", "id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13666v1", "updated":
